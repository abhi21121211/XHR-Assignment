# XHR Mastery Assignment

## Introduction
The XHR Mastery Assignment is a project aimed at demonstrating proficiency in using XMLHttpRequest (XHR) to interact with web servers. The assignment includes three levels of implementation:

- **Level 1 (L1) - Basic XHR Implementation**: Fetches and displays a list of posts from a provided API endpoint using XHR. Handles error scenarios appropriately.
  
- **Level 2 (L2) - Interactive Application with XHR**: Enhances the application to allow users to add new posts using a form. Sends data to the provided API endpoint via XHR POST request. Implements client-side form validation and proper error handling.

- **Level 3 (L3) - Integrating XHR with React**: Converts the application into a React application, managing state using React hooks. Fetches data using XHR within React components, displaying loading indicators and handling errors gracefully.
